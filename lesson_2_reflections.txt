What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A ".git" directory will be created under the directory where "git init"
	is executed. I need it because it contains support files necessary for
	git functionalities like tracking changes and saving commits.

How is the staging area different from the woking directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area contains part of the files in the working directory. It 
	provides a buffer area before committing to allow us to organize all the 
	files we want to save into the next version of our project files.
